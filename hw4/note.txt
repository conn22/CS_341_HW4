This program does not work. I believe something is incorrect in the orders.js script in the /hw4/routes directory. 
However, it is also possible that the issue is in the edits I made to app.js, although that seems less likely. 
Because I could not get Express to function, I could not write a Jest unit test for the orders script. 
I also did not have the necessary code to complete part 3, where the previous orders from past months are displayed.
